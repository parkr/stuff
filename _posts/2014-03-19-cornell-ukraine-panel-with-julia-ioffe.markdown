I attended this spectacular panel talk last Friday (March 14, 2014)
hosted by the Cornell Democrats which featured four distinguished
panelists:

1. [Julia Ioffe of The New Republic][]
2. [Fredrik Logevall][], Director of the Cornell University Enaudi Center
   of International Affairs
3. [Len Surzhko-Harned][], an Assistant Professor of political science at
   Mercyhurst University
4. [Kateryna Pishchikova][], a visiting scholar at the Cornell Institute
   for European Studies and associate fellow at FRIDE

The panel is about 2 hours long and in 2 parts on YouTube:

* [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2tELLSUZyc)
* [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE5H7jtmp-c)

Definitely worth a watch -- very informative and the least biased
representation and discussion of the conflict I have yet encountered.
