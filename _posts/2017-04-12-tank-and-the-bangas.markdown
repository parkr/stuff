Tank And The Bangas is a New Orleans based band and the winners of NPR's
Tiny Desk Contest this year. Colorful and soulful, this group's music kept
me smiling and groovin' at my desk all morning.

[Their "victory lap" performance on NPR Music Tiny Desk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKzobTCIRDw)
is some of the most wonderful music I have heard in a while. It's as lively
and free-spirited as their fashion. The final song, an ode to the
excitement of riding a roller coaster and its similarity to the feeling of
falling in love, had me truly taken.

A hat tip is in order for my dear friend [Mia Davis](https://twitter.com/mtotheia) who called my attention to this exquisite performance.
