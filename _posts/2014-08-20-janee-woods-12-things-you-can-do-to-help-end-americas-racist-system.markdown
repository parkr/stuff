Janee Woods has an important message for people like me -- white people.
She has noticed a silence in the white population around her, and she
wants to end it. She describes this silence's roots not in ambivalence, but
in discomfort and uncertainty:

> A lot of white people aren’t speaking out publicly against the killing of
> Michael Brown because they don’t see a space for themselves to engage
> meaningfully in the conversation [...]  It’s not so much that they have
> nothing to say but rather they don’t see an opportunity being opened up
> for them to say something or to do something that matters. Or they might
> not be sure what to say or how to do it. [...] they worry that talking
> about race and differences between cultures might make things worse, or
> they think they rarely see overt racism at play in their everyday lives.
> [...] There’s a real fear of saying the wrong thing even if the intention
> is pure ...

This is a very interesting (and in my case, accurate) description of the
thinking of many white people. I personally haven't said much because I am
afraid of saying the wrong thing or seeming insensitive or otherwise
ignorant to the issues faced by colored people all around the world. I also
grew up with a tendency toward political correctness, and as a result it
feels weird, even now, to use the terms "white," "colored," and "black".
Janee, I'm taking your lead on this one and using the skin color-based
terms. I hope it's OK.

Janee then goes on to lay out the 12 things we white people can -- and
*must*! --  do in order to make a meaningful impact. Read them yourself --
they're all excellent and well within the grasp of the everyday citizen
(no, she doesn't suggest you take a month off from work and go join in the
protests).

My favourite is #12, which is simply called **"Don't give up."**. She
writes:

> We’re 400 years into this racist system and it’s going to take a long,
> long, long time to dismantle these atrocities. The antiracism movement is
> a struggle for generations, not simply the hot button issue of the
> moment. Transformation of a broken system doesn’t happen quickly or
> easily. You may not see or feel the positive impact of your white
> allyship in the next month, the next year, the next decade or even your
> lifetime. But don’t ever stop. Being a white ally matters because your
> thoughts, deeds and actions will be part of what turns the tide someday.
> Change starts with the individual.

Absolutely *brilliant* article. I'm going to try to take this advice -- all
of it -- to become a better ally to the racially oppressed in our society.

Will you?
