I can't quite remember the first time I listened to The Tim Ferriss Show or
encountered Tim Ferriss's work. This blog's first instance is from 2017
when I discovered [Tim's TED Talk on Fear Setting]({% link _posts/2017-07-30-tim-ferriss-on-fear-setting-instead-of-goal-setting.markdown %}).
Tim's podcast has been a source of inspiration and, at times, entertaining
escape like a recent episode with Boyd Varty. Tim's interviewing style has
certainly improved over the years, so newer episodes often uncover deeper
truths or more interesting stories.

My all-time favorite episode to date is [his interview with Mary Karr from
2020](https://tim.blog/2020/11/11/mary-karr/). Mary's wit and open
discussion about all sorts of difficult topics makes this a delight to
listen to.
