I stumbled upon this website via a tweet from a government
enthusiast/employee I found. It's a curated list of "thousands of
interesting Federal Government documents obtained under the Freedom of
Information Act." Plenty of new information published every day. Good for
the pangs of bordem on your local public transit system.
