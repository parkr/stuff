Nick Hanauer suggests an incredibly intriguing (albeit controversial)
alternative view of economic growth and job growth: the **consumers** provide
the driving force that causes job creation, not the suppliers of the goods or
services the workers create/do.

A man with a lot of experience in starting companies, Hanauer makes a simple
argument that has stuck with me:

> I have started or helped start dozens of companies and initially hired lots of
> people but if there was no one around who could afford to buy what we had to
> sell, all those companies and all those jobs would have evaporated. That's why
> I can say with confidence that rich people don't create jobs nor do businesses
> large or small - jobs are a consequence of a circle-of-life-like feedback loop
> between customers and businesses. Only consumers can set in motion this
> virtuous cycle of increasing demand and hiring. In this sense, an ordinary
> consumer is more of a job creator than a capitalist, like me.

He solidifies this further:

> Hiring more people is a course of last resort for capitalist. [...] In this
> sense, calling ourselves job creators isn't just inaccurate, it's
> disingenuous.

Wow. Take a listen to his talk.
