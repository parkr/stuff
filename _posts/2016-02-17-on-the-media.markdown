*On the Media* is a podcast produced by Brooke Gladstone and Bob Garfield
which discusses the media. Thus far, I have found its discussions very
appealing and relevant. Some favourites:

- ["Bench Press"](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/on-the-media-2015-10-09/)
- ["We Got Scooped: SCOTUS Edition"](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/we-got-scooped-scotus-edition/)
- ["6 Months Later..."](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/on-the-media-2015-11-27/)
- ["Common Sense"](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/on-the-media-2016-01-08/)
- ["Lies, Lies, Lies"](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/on-the-media-2015-12-04/)
- ["Politically Correct"](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/on-the-media-2015-12-18)
- ["The Language of Terror"](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/on-the-media-2015-11-20)
- ["Feel This"](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/on-the-media-2015-11-13)

I will update this list occasionally.
