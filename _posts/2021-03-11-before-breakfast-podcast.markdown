"Before Breakfast" is a short (~5 minutes of content) podcast that shares
tips of the day. These are often the kind of "life hacks" folks truly want
to implement in their lives. They're little reminders to take a few minutes
to improve our days. Here are some of my favorite episodes:

- [Do it after your must-do](https://overcast.fm/+Q-kAtHSkU)
- [How to stop being late](https://overcast.fm/+Q-kBSzMUI)
- [Don't be a human reminder](https://overcast.fm/+Q-kDxCEHw)
- [Thinking of you](https://overcast.fm/+Q-kCOXGRk)
- [A crisis can be a turning point](https://overcast.fm/+Q-kCtb-ak)
- [What else could that buy?](https://overcast.fm/+Q-kD0SLRQ
