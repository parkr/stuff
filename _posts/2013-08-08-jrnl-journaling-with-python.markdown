I've been looking for a nice way to journal (I'm not writing often, but I like
to write stuff nevertheless) and discovered this by way of a [tweet from
@aniket_pant][] describing how he uses [Jekyll][] in an unconventional way.

It looks like a nice text-based means of journaling. It has some restrictions
and isn't as flexible as opening a new file in vim, but it looks pretty cool.
