Clay Shirky discusses the implications of a possible shift in FCC policy toward
spectrum allocation. He hits home in the fourth paragraph:

> [Unlicensed spectrum] matters, a lot, because with the spread of unlicensed wireless, the FCC
> could live up to its mandate of managing spectrum on behalf of the public, by
> allowing for and even encouraging engineering practices that treat spectrum
> itself as a public good. A public good, in economic terms, is something that
> is best provisioned for everyone (an economic characteristic called
> non-excludability) and which anyone can use without depleting the resource (a
> characteristic called non-rival use -- individual users aren't rivals for the
> resource.)
