"Letters Live" is an event at the Royal Albert Hall in the UK where
performers read interesting letters aloud to an audience. They're often
short–just a few minutes. I'm partial to the letters which contain that
British wit and sometimes-excessive niceness.

Some of my favorites include:

- [Alan Carr reads a letter to an insurance company describing a sticky situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80I6jBrsRcw)
- [Ian McKellen reads Kurt Vonnegut’s inspirational letter to some students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh9tMqpH8nc)
- [Himesh Patel reads a letter to Richard Branson: 'How can you live like this?'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x_44vFO2c)
- [Taika Waititi reads a hilarious letter about a speeding ticket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUtyCzfuI0)
- [Olivia Colman reads a letter responding to an unsolicited penis photograph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCSYBeWuDhw)
- [Miriam Margolyes reads a letter from a disgruntled care home resident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnWxHmMqAQk)
- [Claire Foy reads a hilarious letter from Phyllida Law to her mother-in-law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2jQLjEmWMM)
