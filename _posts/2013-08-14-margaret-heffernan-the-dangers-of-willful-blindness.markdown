TED Talks are one of my favourite things in the world, and this talk by Margaret
Heffernan is no exception. In this intriguing talk, she discusses the human
propensity for "willful blindness," the legal term which indicates that the
actor has made a conscious choice to ignore knowledge.

Willful blindness is a pressing issue: we burn fossil fuels despite mounting
evidence that it's causing vast ecological damage, we harbor over-generalized
hatred and resentment for large segments of the populations in which we are a
part, etc. It has to stop!
