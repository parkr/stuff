Congressman Chris Van Hollen, through a series of [parliamentary inquiries][],
clarified on the House floor the rule that restricted the privilege of all House
members to suggest that a bill be put up for a vote. It was restricted to "the
majority speaker or his designee," which, in this case, is House Majority Leader
Eric Cantor. This resolution was passed on October 1, 2013.

It's appalling that this happened, but what is more appalling is that the
American people won't do anything about it.
