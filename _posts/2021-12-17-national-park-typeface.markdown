A handful of designers decided to create a typeface which mimics the signs
seen on trails and such at National Parks which are carved by router bits.
It's a playful round sans serif typeface offered in 4 weights.

The website they built for it includes sample shots from national parks
signs and a great story about how they got to working on it.
