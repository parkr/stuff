I picked this up the other day at a grocery store in Pacifica, CA. I went to
Trader Joe's the other day and picked up a bottle of $15 wine (I'm a college
student, that's a nice wine by my standards ;) and put this little guy to the
test. Needless to say, this wine journal is *exquisite*. It asks just the right
questions and brings my wine snobbery level up a notch. So excited to try new
wines so I can find my very favourites and never forget what they are and why I
liked them.
