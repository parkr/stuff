Alison Gopnik has found incredible evidence suggesting that Hume was heavily
influenced by the teachings of Buddhism. One particularly intriguing similarity
is Hume's disagreement with most of his contemporary Western philosophical
colleagues about the self. Indeed, Hume argues quite vehemently what Buddhism
had taught for centuries before: there is no self. One's thoughts, ideas, and
beliefs instead occupy the mind. Nigel Warburton puts it quite eloquently:
