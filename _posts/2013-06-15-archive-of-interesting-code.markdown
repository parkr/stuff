This is a super cool collection of really intereting code in a series of
different languages, from C++ to Python. They are implementations of various
algorithms. My favourites:

- [Heapsort][]
- [Rabin-Karp Algorithm][]
- [Find Duplicate][] (An algorithm to find a repeated element in an array using [Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm][].)
- [Single Sell Profit][]
