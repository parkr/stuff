The Gaither Vocal Band is a Christian White gospel group. It's not quite
Christian rock but not quite gospel (thinking Whitney Houston and the
like). Really good, though. Check out these:

- [Let Freedom Ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9umTQJNkAg)
- [There Is a River](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q8dYPNV4OQ)

Both are live and quite good.
