There has been [some talk recently][] about Ruby's future. It hasn't taken hold
of industry and is starting to lose out to other languages (notably Go &
JavaScript) where concurrency and high-load performance is king. **Rubinius X**
is a project meant to revoltionize Ruby -- to give it the features it needs to
be enterprise-ready but remain easy to use and expressive. Certainly a project
to watch for all the Rubyists out there.
