The American West is running out of water. Each year the aquifers drop to
their lowest levels. Where is all the water going? Vox attempts to answer
this question.

Residential is about 6%, commercial is another 8%. What consumes the other
86%?

**Crop Irrigation.**

The video goes on to describe something called rotational fallowing, where
agencies representing metropolitan water users (commercial/residential) to
set a price that they'll pay farmers to temporarily stop irrigating a
portion of their fields, which farmers can take or leave. I don't think
it's the cure-all that the viewer should be left considering, but it is
worthwhile to watch the video to be more informed about this great
imbalance between agriculture and everything else in the American West.
