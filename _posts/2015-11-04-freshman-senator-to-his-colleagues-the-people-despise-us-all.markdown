A well-crafted speech asking for _better_ argumentation on the Senate
floor, as it is most uniquely capable of debating long-term prioritization
due to its relative insulation from the two-year terms of the House
members.

> Would anything really be lost if the Senate didn't exist? ... What,
> precisely, would be lost if we only had a House of Representatives, a
> simple majoritarian body, instead of both bodies? ... What was the Senate
> built for? ... Probably the best shorthand is this: to shield lawmakers
> from obsession with short-term popularity so that we can focus on the
> biggest long-term challenges we face. Why does the Senate's character
> matter? Precisely because the Senate is built to insulate us from
> "short-term-ism". That's the point of the Senate. This is a place built
> to **insulate us from opinion fads and from the bickering of
> twenty-four-hour news cycles.** That is the point of the Senate.

A bit later...

> "...Isn't the disfunction in here, merely an echo of the broader
> political polarization out there?" It's an important question. "Isn't the
> Senate broken because of the larger shattered consensus of shared belief
> across 320 million people on this land?" Surely, that is part of the story,
> but there is much more to say. First, the political polarization beyond
> Washington is so often overstated. ... Second, civic disengagement is
> arguably a much larger problem than political polarization. It isn't so
> much that most "regular folks" we run into back home are really locked
> into predictably Republican and predictably Democratic positions on every
> issue, it's that they have tuned us out altogether. ... Third, one of our
> jobs here is to flesh out competing views with such seriousness and
> respect that **we, the hundred of us, should be mitigating, not
> exacerbating polarization that does exist**. This is one of the reasons
> we have a representative, rather than direct, democracy. ...
