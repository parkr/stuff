David Wheeler works for the Institute for Defense Analyses and has a few
choice words to say about the government's procurement of software and how
procurement relates to open-source. Specifically, I liked this:

> There are many benefits when government-funded software is released back
> to the people who paid for it. It’s far easier for other government
> agencies to find software once it’s released to the public, and it’s much
> easier to find competing support sources once it’s available to the
> public. I also think it’s harder to reflexively reject OSS when you’re
> also contributing to it.

... and:

> OSS is a vital element for ensuring national economic security.
> Automation is central to practically every modern endeavor. Creating and
> improving automation requires malleable building blocks. In particular,
> innovation necessarily requires building blocks that can be reshaped in
> new ways. By definition OSS is an innovation enabler, because it creates
> far more malleable building blocks. OSS is already widely used and
> developed throughout industry, so it is already vital to industry.
