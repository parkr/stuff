[The Federalist Society][] and the [American Constitution Society][]
invited Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer to discuss
interpretation of the constitution and their general approach to deciding
cases. It's a jovial and extraordinarily interesting conversation and well
worth watching.
