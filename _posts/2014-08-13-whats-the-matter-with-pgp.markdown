Wherein [Matthew Green](https://www.blogger.com/profile/05041984203678598124)
discusses the state of PGP in light of Gmail's and Yahoo!'s "native"
support of it in their respective email services.

Spoiler alert: it's in pretty bad shape.

There's [a great email by Mike Perry on this topic on the `tor-talk` mailing
list](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/030235.html)
that's also worth a read.

Random fact: PGP is older than I am.
