Smalltalk is easily one of the most well-known fundamental object-oriented
programming language. It [inspired Ruby's base
methods](http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/179642)
and is still a fantastic language to learn even though it's not used much
today for production code (as all Smalltalk code has to be redistributed in
under the LGPL license).
