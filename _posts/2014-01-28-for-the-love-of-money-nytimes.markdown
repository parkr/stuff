I have never read a more interesting Opinion piece in the New York Times, than
"For the Love of Money," by Sam Polk.

I said "holy shit" &mdash; out loud, no less &mdash; when I read:

> I see Wall Street’s mantra — “We’re smarter and work harder than everyone
> else, so we deserve all this money” — for what it is: the rationalization of
> addicts. From a distance I can see what I couldn’t see then — that Wall Street
> is a toxic culture that encourages the grandiosity of people who are
> desperately trying to feel powerful.

Read the whole piece &mdash; it is absolutely incredible.
