Carl Sagan is one of the most prolific astronomers and astrophysicists of our
time. In this video, he narrates a most prolific quote - and it's _autotuned_.
A beautiful piece and some incredibly profound words.

> From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular
> interest. But for us, it's different.
>
> Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us.
> On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone
> you've ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.
> The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions,
> ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and
> coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant,
> every couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and
> explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar,
> every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species
> lived there. On a mote of dust. Suspended in a sunbeam.
>
> The Earth is a very
> small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Thick are the rivers of blood spilled by
> all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they can become
> the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.
>
> Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of
> this pixel on the scarcely indistinguishable inhabitants of some other corner.
> How frequent their misunderstandings. How eager they are to kill one another.
> How fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the
> delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe are challenged
> by this point of pale light. It underscores our responsibility to deal more
> kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot.
>
> The only home we've ever known.
