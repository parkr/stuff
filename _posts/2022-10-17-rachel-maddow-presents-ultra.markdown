What a thrilling story... from 1940. In the podcast description:

> Sitting members of Congress aiding and abetting a plot to overthrow the
> government. Insurrectionists criminally charged with plotting to end
> American democracy for good. Justice Department prosecutors under
> crushing political pressure. Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra is the
> all-but-forgotten true story of good, old-fashioned American extremism
> getting supercharged by proximity to power. When extremist elected
> officials get caught plotting against America with the violent ultra
> right, this is the story of the lengths they will go toâ€¦ to cover their
> tracks.
