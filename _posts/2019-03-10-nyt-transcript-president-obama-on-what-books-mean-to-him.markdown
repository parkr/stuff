This transcript of an interview between Michiko Kakutani, the chief book
critic for The New York Times, and President Barack Obama in January of
2017 is a breath of fresh air from our current stifling state of affairs in 2019.
Here, President Obama describes some the way he leans on books as a
means of gaining perspective and centering himself under the bombardment of
the work of being President.

I never much read growing up, always a bit too antsy to sit down for much
longer than 5 minutes. In my post-collegiate days, however, I have made an
effort to read a bit more. Reading was always simply work to me -- always
tied to the reading I was forced to do for school -- and was never
enlightening or enjoyable the way others seemed to find it. More recently,
I have found that a day without at least a half hour of reading is not a
complete day. The way the President describes his attachment to books
resonates so much with me because I have begun to felt an inkling of what
he describes, and I desire for it to grow.

As I improve my ability to stem the flow of information coming in my
direction (removing social media largely from my life has been a big boon
here), I find myself more able & interested in absorbing the stories books
have to tell. This interview was a nice reminder that this feeling of
connection to a story can grow deeper and even more fulfilling over time.
