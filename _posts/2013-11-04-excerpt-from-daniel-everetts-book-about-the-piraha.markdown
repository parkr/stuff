Daniel Everett has been an inspiration to me for a couple years now. His
approach to linguistics is modern and, to me, uniquely experiential. His
controversial findings about the Pirahã tribe in the Brazilian Amazon were so
shocking that much of the global community of linguists still finds his work
incredible. Nevertheless, his arguments about the cultural constraints of
language have sparked a debate amongst linguists the world over on this key
aspect of sociolinguistics: how do culture and language interact?

This video gives an introduction to who Daniel Everett is and how he came to
find himself with the Pirahã and in such a tumultuous debate within the
linguistics community.
