Commencement season has just passed and this gem stood out. The dean of
Harvard School of Education describes the following 5 essential questions
in life:

1. "Wait, what?"
2. "I wonder why..." / "I wonder if..."
3. "Couldn't we at least... ?"
4. "How can I help?"
5. "What truly matters?" / "What truly matters to me?"
6. And a bonus question: "Did you get what you wanted out of life even so?"

Dean Ryan has [written a book on this subject called "Wait, what?"](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062664570/wait-what)
