*New Republic* Senior Editor Noam Scheiber wrote a fantastic piece on Aaron
Swartz. He covers many details not previously seen in ["The Internet's Own
Boy"]({% post_url 2014-07-12-the-internets-own-boy-the-story-of-aaron-swartz %})
and offers the most whole profile of Swartz. He covers the good parts and
the bad parts in a tasteful way, and offers citations for it all.

A bit long, but worth the read.
