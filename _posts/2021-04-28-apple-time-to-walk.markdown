Apple released a feature called "Time to Walk" for Fitness+. They're almost
like podcasts with a built-in workout feature. On your Apple Watch, you
open the Workouts app and choose the Time to Walk episode you'd like to
listen to. It will play directly from your Watch to your AirPods or other
compatible headphone.

Each episode I have enjoyed is really well done. The speaker is also
walking, so you can hear a bit of their surroundings like crunching snow or
chirping birds. The speaker

- [Jane Fonda](https://fitness.apple.com/us/workout/time-to-walk-with-jane-fonda/1562781076) discusses overcoming fear and taking action as an antidote for hopelessness.
- [Wanda Sykes](https://fitness.apple.com/us/workout/time-to-walk-with-wanda-sykes/1560725645) discusses taking chances and getting back on the horse when you fall off.
- [Min Jin Lee](https://fitness.apple.com/us/workout/time-to-walk-with-min-jin-lee/1554949669) discusses finding her voice as she comes of age as a refugee in NYC and begins a career as an author.
- [Jon M. Chu](https://fitness.apple.com/us/workout/time-to-walk-with-jon-m-chu/1561675688) discusses representation, doing the work you don't want to do, and the siezing every lucky break that comes your way.

I have run into a few bugs downloading & playing back the content, but
otherwise the audio itself is a really great motivator for taking a walk.
