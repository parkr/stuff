I myself am a runner (mid-distance, working up to long-distance), and I
have never found a comic as relatable as this one by Matthew Inman, AKA The
Oatmeal. I run for the same reasons, and "The Blerch" is the best
explanation of that feeling during a long run when you want to give up.
Take a few minutes to read through the entire comic! It's a splendid read.
