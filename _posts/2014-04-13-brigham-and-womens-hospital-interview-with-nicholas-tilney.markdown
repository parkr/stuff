Nicholas Tilney was a pioneer in the field of transplantation
surgery (e.g. the *first* surgeon to perform a kidney transplant),
an exceptional scholar (professorships and the whole bit), and my
grandfather. He started his career at Peter Bent Brigham Young Hospital in
the Boston area after he graduated from Cornell University Medical School.
This video is a glimpse into his humour, his charm, and his keen
intelligence: a tiny snapshot of the terrific man he was.

There's a [splendid obituary by *The Boston Globe*](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/04/02/nicholas-tilney-surgeon-scientist-and-writer-directed-brigham-and-women-transplant-service/6H3ecaKLdLFUHhmhAp4qzH/story.html)
