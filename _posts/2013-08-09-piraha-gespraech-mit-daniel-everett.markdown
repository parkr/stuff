This is a fantastic interview with Daniel Everett about the Pirahã, an Amazonian
tribe whose language doesn't have numbers, precise means of indicating time, nor
even _recursion_. Everett's findings cause a lot of ruckus in the Linguistics
community and have been hotly debated by the likes of (the mildly narcisistic)
Noam Chomsky. This interview is in German.
