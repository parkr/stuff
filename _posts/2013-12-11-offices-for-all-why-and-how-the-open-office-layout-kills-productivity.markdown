Jason Feifer, a _Fast Company_ senior editor, describes how open-office layouts
are bad for employees, bosses, and for productivity.

And he's spot-on. Check this out:

I've have the experience of working in both and open and a semi-closed
environment. I found that I was far, far more productive when all distractions
were removed: the sounds of my coworkers tapping on their keyboards and sipping
their coffee silenced; the distraction of cars, trucks and people passing
outside a window eradicated; the allure of social media quieted by the
overwhelming sense that _this is where work gets done, and I have no time for
meaningless videos of cats doing strange things. I would really rather get this
problem fixed so I can move on to the next cool thing._

Open-office layouts sapped every millilitre of productivity out of my mind and
body, and I was almost entirely unable to focus and get good work done. Feifer
illustrates brilliantly this struggle for peace and quiet while at work.
