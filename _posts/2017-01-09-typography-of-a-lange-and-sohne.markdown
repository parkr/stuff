&Larry has a terrific writeup of the intricate focus on typography that the
A. Lange & Söhne watchmakers employ when designing watches. The design of
watches has always fascinated me for the strikingly limited functionality
of a watch: hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds, days, and so forth. The
most advanced watches have a stopwatch capability, but that is as complex
as I have seen them before.

The discussion centers around typography of this particular brand of
watches, but at the end gets into a more general discussion of how many
companies are more aware of how their typography impacts their brand. The
focus on typography from companies like Apple and Google is interesting. Su
Jia Xian, the author of this piece, calls on designers to learn more about
typography and factor typographic choices into design decisions.
