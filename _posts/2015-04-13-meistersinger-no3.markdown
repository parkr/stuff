MeisterSinger is a watch brand that stands distinguished to me. A German
watch-making company based in Münster, its craftsmanship is world-renowned.

Nº03 is a single-hand 12-hour watch. Each notch on the watch face
represents 5 minutes, therefore rendering the watch useless for the minute
details of time. By reducing the transparency of the minutae of time, this
watch renders a sense of time which is fluid and imprecise. Time is no
longer an obstacle to success or an object of worry. As an
East-coaster-turned-West-coaster, this is looking ideal as a means of
assimilating into the more flexible sense of time on the West coast.
