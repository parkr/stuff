Open Culture is a place where the content of today's web &mdash; free, open
content &mdash; is curated in a centralized place. I have found this to be
a terrific resource for getting a nice dose of culture every day.

Some of my favourite posts:

- [Hear Ravel Play Ravel in 1922](https://www.openculture.com/2013/01/ravel_plays_ravel_the_haunting_melancholy_ioiseaux_tristesi_1922.html)
- [Hear Debussy Play Debussy: A Vintage Recording from 1913](https://www.openculture.com/2013/01/debussy_plays_debussy_the_great_composers_playing_returns_to_life.html)

Their collection of [800 free ebooks](https://www.openculture.com/free_ebooks)
is impressive and very necessary.

I love the movement toward open culture where rich content is free to all.
