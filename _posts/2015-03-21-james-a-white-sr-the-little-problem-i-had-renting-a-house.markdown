In this excellent TED Talk, Mr. White describes the racial prejudice he
encountered as a US Air Force air corpsman. He delivers the story of this
injustice with a cool head. I can only imagine his anger and frustration
when he was continuously told he couldn't do something because of the color
of his skin. Take a listen.
