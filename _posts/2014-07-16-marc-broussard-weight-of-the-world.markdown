Marc Broussard is a musical, lyrical, and human genius. His voice is
incredible and this latest song has backup singers. BACKUP SINGERS.
Soulful in every magical sense of the word.

According to
[americansongwriter.com](http://www.americansongwriter.com/2014/07/video-premiere-marc-broussard-weight-world-acoustic/),
Marc said:

> “This song is all about keeping love simple. Keeping it all between two
> people and not caring about what the world says. My wife and I ran away
> to get married and had very few witnesses, most of whom were almost
> complete strangers. It didn’t matter that our friends and family missed
> our altar moment because it wasn’t about them.”
