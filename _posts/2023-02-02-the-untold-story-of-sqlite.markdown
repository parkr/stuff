Richard Hipp is the creator of SQLite, one of (if not, *the*) most deployed
pieces of software ever created. In this interview he describes why he
initially created it and how it evolved over the years.

As an open source maintainer myself, I’m struck by how he incorporated
enhancements for companies as they asked for them. In my experience many
enhancements companies ask for are difficult to incorporate- they’re either
too narrowly focused to be generally useful to the user base, or force the
project to take on significant added complexity. It’s impressive how
Richard has been able to intelligently incorporate enhancement requests
from external stakeholders for so many years.
