[@benbalter][] has collected a great list of books about open source and general
geekery and it's pretty rad. My favourites are definitely [The Wealth of
Networks][] by Yochai Benkler and [Peopleware: Productive Projects & Teams][] by
Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister. Check out Ben's list and give a few of them a
read.
