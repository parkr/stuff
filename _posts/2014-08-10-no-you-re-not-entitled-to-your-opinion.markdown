This article was waiting for me ever so patiently, and boy, am I glad I
found it. My favourite excerpt:

> If “Everyone’s entitled to their opinion” just means no-one has the right
> to stop people thinking and saying whatever they want, then the statement
> is true, but fairly trivial. No one can stop you saying that vaccines
> cause autism, no matter how many times that claim has been disproven.
>
> But if ‘entitled to an opinion’ means ‘entitled to have your views
> treated as serious candidates for the truth’ then it’s pretty clearly
> false. And this too is a distinction that tends to get blurred.

Yes.
