This talk is a moving and inspiring tale of one man's hope for the future
of his country. His work makes a tremendous difference in the lives of tens
of thousands of South Sudanese every day, and has had a profound impact on
many in the U.S. as well, including my family.

Salva Dut is one of the [Lost Boys of Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Boys_of_Sudan).
He came to the U.S. in the late 90's as a refugee. Arriving in Dallas, TX,
he was given an apartment and integrated into the church community. He had
trouble adjusting to the new culture; he remarks in this talk about having
trouble remembering to turn on the light when he entered a room.
Electricity available to anyone who had access to an outlet was a huge
luxury. After staying a few months in Dallas, he relocated to Rochester,
NY. That's where my family met him.

He joined our church in downtown Rochester, which had a community of other
Lost Boys, some 15 or 20 who leaned on us for help with our culture as we
leaned on them for help understanding theirs. Salva found a job and an
apartment before winter came, but was still learning what to expect for the
cold weather to come. Coming from sub-Saharan Africa and having only lived
in Dallas in North America, he wasn't sure what to expect. Fall came and my
mother in particular bonded with Salva. She made sure he had a thick winter
coat and that the central heating in his apartment was setup properly. She
would bring him groceries and spend time with him as he had it.

Salva went to the local community college and studied Business and Spanish.
He worked very hard and thrived. I still remember the piles of books and
papers sitting on the desk and floor in his room. He was always studying.
As he discusses in this talk, he got word that his father was sick and flew
back to Sudan. His father, sick with a waterborne illness, needed fresh
drinking water if he was going to live a long, healthy life. Upon coming
back to the U.S., Salva got together with other members of the church and
founded Water for Sudan, now [Water for South Sudan, Inc.](https://www.waterforsouthsudan.org/)
