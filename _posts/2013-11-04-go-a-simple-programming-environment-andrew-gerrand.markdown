[Andrew Gerrand][], a Google employee and major contributor to [Go][] (a.k.a.
`golang`), gave a talk on Go at Railsberry 2013. It introduces some basic
concepts of the language as well as some key applications. Go has really taken
off and is a joy to use. Check out this video ([slides][]) then take a crack at
Go for your next project!
