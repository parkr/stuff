Árstíðir is a 4-man Icelandic choral group. They sing magnificent music and
have offered me a new cultural experience (not much Icelandic music in
Upstate New York). They are world-class musicians and deserving of every
award they have received, and more. Listen to these:

- ["Heyr himna smiður" (Icelandic hymn) in train station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4dT8FJ2GE0)
- ["Svefns Og Vöku Skil", their latest album](https://arstidir.bandcamp.com/album/svefns-og-v-ku-skil)
- [Kickstarter for their third album](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/arstidir/arstiir-music-from-the-heart-of-iceland-our-third)

If that doesn't impress you, I don't know what will.
