What a stunning piece by the 19th & 20th century composer [Alexander
Scriabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Scriabin), performed by
the [Frankfurt Radio
Symphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_Radio_Symphony).

It was the first time I have (knowingly) encountered Scriabin and I was
really quite transported by the sweeping musical ideas. Highly recommend!
