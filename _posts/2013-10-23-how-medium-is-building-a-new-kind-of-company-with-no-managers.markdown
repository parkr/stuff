The idea of manager-free companies is enthralling. I've heard mostly about the
way [GitHub][] is run ([see this post on adopting open-source project process
constraints][] by Ryan Tomayko), but it sounds very similar to what is described
here. [Medium][] has taken a role-centric approach to structuring its teams,
yes, but bases them on tasks and responsibilities, rather than some name. No one
but the founders (I imagine) has ultimate authority -- everything must be argued
until the other parties agree and all work is (somewhat)
intrinsically-motivated. It's a really cool idea that by offering employees the
possibility for motivation from within, the company gets the absolute best work
from its employees and the team is able to grow organically.
