Setosa has compiled visual explanations of several interesting topics,
including Pi, Sine & Cosine, Exponentiation, Markov Chains, and Conditional
Probability. If you have any interest in mathematics, this is an excellent
resource. An understanding of the theoretical concepts is simply reaffirmed
and hardened by the visualizations.

Certainly worth a look.
