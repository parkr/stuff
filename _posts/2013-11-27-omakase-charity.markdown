[Theresa Preston-Werner][] and [her team](https://omakasecharity.org/about) have
launched a brand new start-up in San Francisco focused on driving charitable
giving by techies. It is, in Theresa's words, a "monthly subscription service
for curated charitable giving." It's terrific! You can even sign up for it with
your GitHub account.

This post is about the amazing TechCrunch article (wut?) about what Omakase
Charity is, what its motivations are, and how we can help.
