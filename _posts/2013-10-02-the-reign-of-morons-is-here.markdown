This article is absolutely magnificent. The first paragraph, perhaps, even
more so:

> In the year of our Lord 2010, the voters of the United States elected the
> worst Congress in the history of the Republic. There have been Congresses
> more dilatory. There have been Congresses more irresponsible, though not
> many of them. There have been lazier Congresses, more vicious Congresses,
> and Congresses less capable of seeing forests for trees. But there has never
> been in a single Congress &#8212; or, more precisely, in a single House of
> the Congress &8#8212; a more lethal combination of political ambition,
> political stupidity, and political vainglory than exists in this one, which
> has arranged to shut down the federal government because it disapproves of a
> law passed by a previous Congress, signed by the president, and upheld by the
> Supreme Court, a law that does nothing more than extend the possibility of
> health insurance to the millions of Americans who do not presently have it,
> a law based on a proposal from a conservative think-tank and taken out on the
> test track in Massachusetts by a Republican governor who also happens to
> have been the party's 2012 nominee for president of the United States. That
> is why the government of the United States is, in large measure, closed this
> morning.

Freakin' beautiful.
