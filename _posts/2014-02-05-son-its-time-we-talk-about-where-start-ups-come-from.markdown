[Marco Kaye](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/authors/marco-kaye) writes what is on all
our minds, namely that our start-up culture has become so bloated that it's time
to consider *not* starting up the next tech company. Make sure it's a really,
really good idea before executing, or you'll fail and generally pretty fast.

My favourite excerpt:

> All I ask is that before getting involved in any start-up, talk to us. Mom and
> I would never forbid you from following your dreams. Strongly discourage,

Brilliant.
