In 1995, when the Internet was still young, two astronomers began a public
feed of astronomy photos. They called it "Astronomy Picture of the Day."
These astronomers, Robert Nemiroff and Jerry Bonnell, have posted fantastic
photographs and videos of astronomical phenomena continuously every since.

These days, many entries are
[submitted](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/apsubmit2015.html) from folks
all over the world, enthusiasts and professionals alike. A [recent post
entitled Nacreous Clouds over
Lapland](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230209.html) caught my eye and I had
to share it here:

![Nacreous clouds, a.k.a. mother of pearl clouds in

Enjoy the splendor of our universe!
