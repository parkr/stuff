Here, Lapham writes of American exceptionalism as a means to separate
ourselves from others. This division is a tool to reinforce neurotic fear
which has formed the basis for the American psyche since the dawn of the
Cold War. Americans, great and true, are most afraid not of death but of
each other. Once the Cold War ended, the plutocracy needed a new enemy to
reinforce this neurotic fear. They came up with each other: black
Americans, gay Americans, atheistic Americans, "elites," etc. We declared
war on drugs (whatever that means; the crack and heroin won't put up a
fight) that turned up our policing and reinforced a fear much closer to
home. Our neighbors could not be trusted. This worked for the 90's as
police forces swelled with new recruits and military-grade toys. In 2001,
already afraid of the Russians and of each other, we got a new foe:
"terrorism." As if we didn't realize we were already being terrorized by
our own news media and government, we blindly waltzed into an unending fear
of fear itself. This cesspool is what allowed the orange man's rhetoric to
work. Stoking that fear and declaring its "cause" fixed in his first 100
days, he won. We must stop being afraid.

After I read this article, I ran out to Barnes & Noble to buy a copy of
this issue of [Lapham's Quarterly](https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/).
