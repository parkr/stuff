Kim Burrell. I first heard Kim Burrell when I watched her lead a rendition
of "Expect a Mirace" & "Changed" with the All Star Womens Choir. A friend
of mine showed it to me after my first year of college and I was
immediately hooked. I loved the vocal acrobatics, her intense spirit, and
her confidence in leading and preaching. This page serves as a compilation
of my favourite Kim Burrell performances. Many of these are live -- I think
she's much better live than on her records.
