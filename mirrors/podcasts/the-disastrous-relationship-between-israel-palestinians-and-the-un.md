title: '"The Disastrous Relationship Between Israel, Palestinians and the U.N." - The Ezra Klein Show'
---

[MUSIC]<br>
From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
<br>[MUSIC]<br>
On Friday May 10th, the UN General Assembly passed a
resolution saying
Palestinians qualify for full member status at the UN.
In the end, the vote was overwhelming.
In favor 143, against nine, abstentions 25.
[APPLAUSE]
This was new.
The General Assembly had never voted for that before.
But they did so now in overwhelming numbers.
The final vote was 143 to 9, Israel voted against it, so
did the United States.

Now to make Palestinians, to make Palestine a full member
of the UN
would take a Security Council approval.
The US would veto that.
Our position is that a Palestinian state should only emerge
through negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis.
But the vote itself was a sign of the chasm that is opening
between not only Israel and
the UN, but America too.

Israelis have long felt the UN is biased against them.
In 1975, the UN voted to declare Zionism a form of racism.
They were appealed that in 1991.
From 2015 to 2022, the UN General Assembly adopted 140
resolutions on Israel.
Over that same period, it passed 68 resolutions on all
other countries combined.

At the same time, the UN was instrumental in the creation
of Israel,
 voting to partition the land of historic Palestine between
 Jews and Palestinians.
 And giving a majority of it to Jews.
 Palestinians feel the UN, in particular, and international
 law in general,
 has been a procession of false promises.
 Where is their state, their self-determination?
 Where is the right of return for their displaced?
 What have all these resolutions and condemnations amounted
 to?
 
 Aslı Ü. Bâli is a professor at Yale Law School who specializes
 in international law.
 Now I want to have her on to trace a deeper question here too.
 One that stretches beyond Israel and Gaza, to Russia,
 Ukraine, and really the whole world.
 What is international law actually for?
 
 Aslı Bâli, welcome to the show.
 
 Thank you for having me.
 
 EK: So I think the way we normally think about laws is that
 they are rules where,
 if you break them, some kind of external actor comes in to
 enforce a punishment, right?
 Maybe a sanction, maybe imprisonment.
 With that definition, is international law actually made up
 of laws?
 
 AB: It is made up of laws, and it sort of depends on where you
 sit.
 
 So if we take an average-sized country with an average
 military capacity and an average economy,
 it might be very much deterred, just by the presence of the
 rules themselves,
 from doing things that it could reasonably anticipate would
 be subject to punishment under the rules,
 like sanctions, or punishment like international adjudication,
 and it would depend a little bit what kind of violation it
 was and whose interests were at stake.
 But there are many, many contexts in international law
 where it operates just the same way
 that you expected to operate in a domestic legal system.
 
 AB: We are thinking about international law from the
 perspective of sitting in the United States,
 a country that is the author of most of the rules, a rule
maker, and not very often a rule taker,
 in part because it's by far the most powerful state in the
 international system.
 And we tend to project, from that experience of
 understanding international law in, let's say,
 an a la carte manner, to how all states in the
 international system might regard international law.
 But that's wrong.
 
 EK: I think that makes sense to me, but one of the things I was
 looking at before we talked was
 what, since roughly 2000, have been the conflicts with the
 most terrible casualty accounts.
 And when you look at that, you actually do see a lot of
 countries that are not hugely powerful
 international actors. I mean, you see Syria on there, you
 see Yemen, you know, the Yemen Civil War,
 you see Ethiopia and Eritrea. And all of these, and some of
 them in particular, have had terrible
 atrocities associated with them. But the fact that the
 perpetrators weren't particularly powerful
 did not seem to create some opening by which the
 international community could stop the bloodletting.
 
 AB: Yeah. In the two specific examples you just gave that you
 began with in Syria and Yemen,
 the reason for this is because smaller or less powerful
 actors can seek great power patrons
 in the international system. And those very powerful states
 can disable mechanisms of enforcement
 and accountability. 
 
 AB: So in the case of Syria, it has
 cultivated a relationship with Russia,
 and Russia has effectively used its veto power at the
 Security Council to shield Syria from
 various forms of accountability that were very much on the
 table. With respect to Yemen,
 the source of impunity has been the United States, and
 Saudi Arabia has been able to wield its own
 influence backed by the United States at the UN through a
 variety of backroom negotiations
 and open threats. So the cases you began with are cases
 where great powers stopped accountability
 from occurring through their veto in the Security Council
 and other means.
 
 AB: That still leaves the other example you gave, which is Erit
rea and Ethiopia. And I would add
 to that one more, which is the conflict that has consumed
 the Great Lakes region in Africa
 since the late 1990s, where you have had millions of people
 displaced, millions of people killed and
 injured, and essentially very little by way of
 international intervention. These are cases where
 no great power is interested and is willing to generate the
 political will to engage
 the institutional accountability mechanisms that exist,
 because there isn't, for example,
 a domestic audience cost. There isn't an outcry
 domestically over that particular conflict
 in the Great Lakes region DRC example that I gave you.
 There's no comparison between the level of
 attention and scrutiny given by the American public to
 conflicts that are occurring in Europe
 or in the Middle East, and those that are occurring in
 parts of Africa, where the United States is not
 historically deeply implicated or engaged. 
 
 EK: So what I hear
 you saying here in different directions,
 is that for international law, like for other kinds of law,
 power really matters.
 
 AB: Yeah, and if you would let me indulge in just one more
 example, in the context of the 1990s,
 when the United States was by far the most powerful state
 in the international
 system and uncontested sort of unipolar moment, there were
 two major crises that involved clear
 evidence of crimes against humanity, possibly genocidal
 crimes and violence. One was in Yugoslavia,
 and the other one was in Rwanda, and there was enormous
 international attention to these contexts,
 and yet there was still a reluctance to do the first thing
 that international law might have
 required, which is to trigger measures through the UN
 Security Council that would wield
 international power to get the violence to stop. And there
 were constant calls for this,
 but from the United States perspective, in painful
 punishing experience in Somalia earlier in the
 1990s, had yielded the lesson that we will not be
 implicated in judgments by the Security Council
 suggesting that such an obligation might exist, for example, 
 by characterizing the conflict in
 Rwanda as a genocide, we will not allow this because this
 will drag us into
 engagements that we do not wish to be part of. 
 
 AB: Eventually,
 of course, because the Yugoslav
 conflict was unfolding on European soil, eventually you did
 have a direct intervention,
 but it took a very long time. And so that's another example
 of a place, it's sort of in between,
 where international law is definitely being used. It's
 shaping the responses of actors,
 but it's being deployed in a way that defers the urgency of
 the moment and allows bloodletting to
 continue. Before we get into the conflict, we're actually
 really here to talk about, I guess I
 want to ask a more personal question of view, which is this
 seems from everything you are describing
 here to be an incredibly frustrating world to work in. I
 know a number of international lawyers,
 I know people who care deeply about international law, and
 they are unerringly some of the most
 idealistic, most just disoriented people I have ever met.
 And yet what we're describing here,
 what you're describing here is a world where powerful
 states decide whether enforcement actions
 will be taken, where power decides whether the law will
 apply at all, where the relevant body
 of the UN that decides on security actions is dominated by
 a small number of very powerful
 players wielding vetoes. How do you balance the sort of
 belief in the laws as written,
 and your sort of recognition of the way that practical
 politics and power end up shaping and
 warping their application? So the international peace and
 security order that we have emerged
 out of the Second World War, which resulted in the deaths
 of at least 30 million civilians,
 which caused untold damage to the world over, although we
 tend in the United States to focus
 exclusively on the European theater. So the architecture
 that was established for the
 international legal order in the aftermath of the Second
 World War prioritized peace over justice
 without any doubt in my view. The nations were united. The
 big five China, Russia, Britain,
 France, and the United States led the peoples of the world
 as they launched a rule of international
 law and a bill of human rights, a rule of law they believed
. No nation, large or small, would dare
 defy. The architecture of the United Nations security order
 gives asymmetric power to the
 victors of the Second World War that were also assessed at
 that time to be the most powerful states
 in the international system, states that now have nuclear
 weapons. Any war between those five states
 threatens planetary extinction and as a result must at all
 costs be avoided. The architecture
 of the UN endows them with this asymmetric power as a
 mechanism to keep them inside of the institution,
 negotiating the differences amongst them rather than resort
ing to extra diplomatic,
 extra political means to resolve their conflicts. Now,
 imagine a universe in which the great majority
 of countries agree that the circumstances in Israel,
 Palestine represent a threat to international
 peace and security and require imperatively international
 intervention. The United States
 would interpret such an intervention as a direct threat to
 one of its most core interests of
 enormous consequence. And so immediately you would be in a
 situation in which one nuclear power would
 be on one side of the equation and arguably one or more
 nuclear powers would be on the other side
 of a conflict. There is a real risk that any number of
 geopolitical zones of conflict, including
 Israel, Palestine, including the Middle East, could become
 the site of a metastasizing,
 globalizing conflict in which one or more of these nuclear
 states is ranged against the other.
 But the institutional design of the United Nations system
 is intended to prevent that by enabling
 each of these powers to paralyze any action when one of
 these great powers understands its interests
 to be threatened. That's the design of the system.
 International law, though, has other
 characteristics too. For one thing, it is a recognition of
 the sovereign equality of all states,
 regardless of their ability to defend their borders milit
arily. So it's a system that as a de jure
 matter recognizes equality amongst fundamentally unequal
 units in the international system and
 affords some possibility for smaller states to protect
 their own independence using a normative
 language in which all actors recognize the states in the
 international system have a shared vocabulary.
 That's an incredibly valuable possibility. It's a language
 that makes it possible to make
 normative claims on the powerful and to limit the degree to
 which they exercise their power in
 ways that are deeply compromising of the interests of
 states that are far weaker. So the basic
 decision made to build an international institutional
 architecture that recognizes those asymmetries
 of power and keeps those countries in, even at the price of
 paralyzing the security order in
 circumstances where they believe their interests are at
 stake, is a decision to prioritize the
 avoidance of a Third World War over justice as part of the
 actual internal institutional structure
 of international law itself. You've said that the creation
 of the state of Israel and the creation
 of the of international law as we know it today are interw
oven. How so?
 So one of the things that the League of Nations did after
 World War I was oversee the territories
 of collapsed empires that were defeated in the course of
 the First World War and whose
 territories were now no longer under imperial dominion. On
 the land empire of the Ottoman Empire
 in the Middle East, the territories were not deemed capable
 of self-government and were placed instead
 under mandates, a kind of trusteeship, in the hands of
 colonial powers. One of those was the
 Palestine mandate and it was bequeathed to Britain to
 oversee as a mandate that was supposed to
 enable the self-determination of the people on that
 territory. There were a range of events for two
 decades as the British maintained this mandate authority in
 which you had increasing emigration
 of Jews from Europe and elsewhere to Palestine as part of
 their goal to establish a state on the
 Palestinian territory that would realize the ambitions of
 the Zionist movement which was born
 in Europe in the 19th century and the British authorities
 were extremely supportive of the goal
 of Jewish communities to establish a Jewish homeland in
 Palestine. It was something that was conceived
 of as a solution to an ongoing problem of Europe which was
 the kind of raging antisemitism
 and the violence that came with it that culminated horrific
ally in the Shoah in the Second World War
 but of course had punctuated European history for centuries
 before that with pogroms and
 persecution across the continent. And then of course you
 had the indigenous Arab population
 of Palestine that were seeking self-determination and
 independence as were the Arab populations of
 the other mandates, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, etc. And so of
 course this was producing intercommunal
 clashes because you now had two communities that were
 seeking to engage in self-determination on
 one land. And so this conflict raged for two decades and at
 the end of the Second World War
 the British basically having difficulty maintaining
 imperial control as a general matter
 turned its mandate in Palestine over to the newly formed
 United Nations and was asked to make a
 judgment about what should be done about these competing
 ambitions for a homeland. At a special
 session the General Assembly of the United Nations
 established a special committee on Palestine
 and sent it to this troubled area to study the problems and
 make recommendations. The judgment
 that the United Nations made was that the land would be
 partitioned between the Jewish community
 which would get roughly 55% of the land and the Arab
 community which would get roughly 45%
 of the land. The Palestinians of the territory were accord
ed less than half of the territory that
 had been part of the mandate. They objected to this, they
 also constituted a very very large
 majority on that territory at the time. But the Arab
 rejection led to a war and in that war the
 Jewish forces gained a larger proportion of the territory
 even than had been assigned to them in
 the partition leaving 22% of the territory under Arab
 control and the remainder under Jewish control.
 Israel was admitted to membership in the United Nations and
 her flag was raised at
 Lake Success. Again the United Nations had through peaceful
 mediation resolved an international dispute
 which had been a threat to world peace. So that's as of
 1949 but in the following
 two decades the UN presided over a much much wider scale
 decolonization of territories that had been
 colonial possessions of Britain and France and other
 European powers across the Middle East,
 Africa and parts of Asia. And this enormous wave of decolon
ization brought dozens of new countries
 into the United Nations, newly independent countries all of
 whom were highly committed to a model
 of decolonization that enabled populations under colonial
 rule to achieve self-determination.
 So one thing I think this gets at is the way in which there
 are these two narratives that sit
 alongside each other about the foundation of the state of
 Israel and the sort of world we
 know and inhabit around that which is one is it it was an
 act of the United Nations right it was a
 there was a piece of paper there was a partition plan and
 another is that the UN was a bit of a
 sideshow and there was a war and that sort of understanding
 Israel and for that matter Palestine
 and Palestinians as constructs of international law has
 both always been tempting because international
 has always been right there but has actually been wrong
 because in the end the UN did not send in
 peacekeepers or soldiers to enforce its own partition it
 did not send in people to create its own
 preferred outcome and so there's been this tendency to look
 outside of the conflict for this arbitrating
 authority of the UN that has always been right there
 alongside the conflict and still is but has
 never actually been able to manage or effectively structure
 it how do you think about the way these
 sort of two tracks of interpretation have evolved alongside
 each other. So I think that the second
 track that you describe which just views the creation of
 the state of Israel as a fact of war
 is problematic for a couple of reasons the first is that it
 doesn't ask a set of questions that are
 the predicate to that war being possible how was it that
 there was an idea that an Israeli state would
 emerge on a mandate from the Ottoman Empire that was called
 the Palestine mandate for the population
 that was on that territory at the time of the end of the
 First World War that too was an instrument
 of international law the mandates were created as a
 consequence of the Versailles peace treaty and
 the British exercised its power as a matter of
 international law over Palestine and of course
 many would argue violated the terms of a mandate by
 enabling a kind of pattern of immigration and
 demographic change along with commitments political and
 legal to another community to achieve self
 determination on that same territory. And this connects to
 the ways in which international law
 itself has long been prior to World War II and since a
 system of rules that essentially have
 facilitated European let's say now Western or global North
 control over swaths of territory
 that were defined lawfully as colonies. So the thing you'll
 hear from Israelis on this is they
 feel the UN is biased against them. You'll hear that from
 2015 to 2022 the UN General Assembly adopted
 140 resolutions on Israel it adopted 68 resolutions on all
 other countries combined even though this
 is a period when there was a lot of war a lot of atrocity a
 lot of human rights abuses in places
 like Syria and Yemen. So there is a specific level of
 interest in Israel and the Palestinians
 that I think if you're just looking at I'd say casual
 accounts of different wars and conflicts
 you wouldn't be able to predict. So it's the only territory
 that had been slated to be decolonized
 at the creation of the United Nations that had inherited
 from that previous system that has not
 been decolonized. It is not disproportionate to the
 attention that was paid to apartheid South
 Africa where the territory continued to be under white
 minority rule. For decades in the United
 Nations these two challenges were understood as ongoing
 examples of incomplete decolonization
 that continued long after the rest of the world had been
 fully decolonized.
 At the beginning of the 1990s there was an expectation
 globally that both of these
 remaining dossiers of incomplete decolonization were on the
 cusp of being resolved one of them
 because of the transition within South Africa to a post-dep
artheid constitutional regime
 and the other because of the Oslo peace process and the
 imminent possibility of the emergence
 of a Palestinian state. In the context of Israel-Palestine
 the two-state solution did not come to fruition
 and as a consequence now Palestine remains the one instance
 that goes right back to the founding
 of the United Nations of an example that a majority of
 states at the UN continue to interpret
 through the lens of incomplete decolonization. So from the
 US perspective decolonization is over
 it was a good thing and now we're in this post-Cold War
 order but from the perspective of the world
 that was subject to colonial dominion the question of dec
olonization remains very live
 and the continuities between the experience quite recent I
 would add historical experience
 of their nations and the current scenes that are emanating
 out of Israel-Palestine makes this
 an ongoing issue of concern for them if only for symbolic
 reasons and if only to a limited
 extent. So voting on UN General Assembly resolutions is not
 exactly the same as having serious skin in
 the game but those 143 states in the international system
 understand the Palestinians as entitled
 to self-determination and a state. 50 countries in the
 world don't recognize Palestinian statehood
 and there's an enormous overlap between those 50 countries
 and the former colonial powers in
 the international system and so in that circumstance I
 think you can see why it is that what you're
 describing as disproportionate attention is actually
 attention to the one case that continues to reflect
 this long-standing grievance of the global south over the
 role that international law has played
 in enabling subordination. The view I often hear from
 Israelis about this
 is that they feel there is something unusual about the
 belief that Israel itself is unusual
 and it's an attack they often lob specifically of the
 United States which is itself a nation that
 was settled, settled with enormous violence to it. There is
 a lot of blood in the founding and
 blood in the early years of the country and that at some
 point that is no longer questioned,
 right? There isn't an effort anywhere to say should the US
 continue to exist and to Israelis
 there are many countries that look like that, that their
 foundations have a war in them,
 they've finished and have an expulsion in them but that
 country is now kind of accepted as just
 a country, not sort of an open case file whereas Israel
 they feel like there is somehow
 softer clay around them than other countries that don't
 look all that different in their origins.
 Do you think there's validity to that feeling and if so
 does it reflect that Israel emerges after
 the formation of the UN in this world of international law
 or is it something else?
 I do think it has to do with the fact that Israel emerges
 after the rules have changed.
 So it's quite true that the United States was founded in a
 very similar fashion with European
 settlement and in fact much more violent the genocide of
 the indigenous population,
 expropriation of its lands, enslavement of peoples, trans
atlantic slave trade, etc.
 There's nothing to celebrate about the origin story of the
 United States from that perspective
 as a matter of international law except that at the time
 that all of that happened there weren't
 clear laws that excluded that. In fact quite the opposite
 as I mentioned,
 international law facilitated colonial conquest of non-
European lands and territories and offered
 a set of justificatory frameworks for enabling that. So
 first of all there was already international
 law applicable that treated Palestinians differently than
 indigenous populations of earlier centuries
 as a consequence of the end of the First World War and the
 creation of the League of Nations.
 Palestinians had already been recognized as a people with a
 legitimate right of self-determination
 subject to a mandate that was understood as a trust in
 order for them to have their welfare
 preserved by I mean however cynically by a colonial power
 until such time as they could
 exercise their right of self-government. And secondly
 following the end of the Second World War
 there were new rules about the conduct of war and the
 protection of refugees. So it was against
 that backdrop that Israel came into existence and it's less
 that it's considered a state unlike all
 other states and it's not an incomplete file as such just
 on the Israeli side. It's rather the idea
 that today you have 14 million people on this territory,
 half of them were recognized as having
 their own right of self-determination and that has been
 frustrated. The other half has achieved a
 threat of self-determination. So Israel has created a state
 that is an expression of the
 recognized right of self-determination of the Jewish people
 but is continually behaving in ways that
 essentially deny Palestinians the ability to achieve the
 same. All of those efforts that you
 described of external actors to impose solutions of one
 kind or another whether they be unilaterally
 the British or the Americans or the United Nations as an
 international organization.
 One thing they run up against is that there are actually
 two communities on the ground whose
 preferences need to be taken into account. One of them is
 asymmetrically more powerful than the
 other. Each of the rounds that you described or that we've
 discussed so far have greatly favored
 the Israeli side in one way or another. The least example
 of that is the UN Partition Plan,
 all subsequent plans have enabled Israel to retain far
 larger swaths of territory.
 Territory acquired by use of force in a time when
 international law prohibits the acquisition of
 territory through the use of force. So these agreements,
 these externally backed agreements,
 have systematically favored the more powerful side and the
 inconvenient reality on the ground
 is that there are two populations of equal size on the
 territory. 7 million Palestinians, 7 million
 Jewish citizens of Israel and it has proven impossible to
 force through external pressure or by dent
 of arms Palestinians to simply accept their subordination
 as a legal matter and so you have an ongoing
 conflict. Let me pull us into the present here and look at
 another body of international law,
 which is the international laws around war and conflict.
 And let me begin on the part that I think
 people are talking less about right now, which is that on
 10/7 you have Hamas fighters crossing
 to Israel. They kill around 1200 people, most of them
 civilians. They take hundreds of hostages,
 many of them civilians. What is international law to say
 about that?
 So they clearly violated the laws of war by first
 deliberately targeting civilians,
 secondly taking civilians hostage, which is also imper
missible. And then ongoing indiscriminate
 rocket fire is another source of violation. So there's
 undoubtedly war crimes committed
 by armed Palestinian factions, including Hamas on October 7
th.
 If Israel wanted to rely on an international law here as
 both a matter of defense and a matter
 of justice, what would it have said or done? So it had a
 number of potential options.
 It could have engaged in a police action in Gaza, seeking
 to apprehend individuals that
 they held responsible for the October 7th attacks. It would
 probably have begun with investigation
 on Israeli territory of who actually was responsible for
 taking the individuals that had been captured
 alive on Israeli territory, interrogating them, and then
 seeking to gain access to or
 jurisdiction over those that were held responsible. It
 could have engaged in a much narrower set of
 engagements attempting to target facilities that made it
 possible for armed actors to cross
 the border in the way it had. And primarily, it could have
 shorted up its own defenses because
 the conditions that enabled the October 7th attack to occur
 was not some new unexpected
 capacity on the part of armed actors that represent an
 ongoing existential threat to Israel,
 but rather a failure to maintain basic defenses at the
 border with Gaza.
 Israel has responded with the view that Hamas is a kind of
 organized fighting force
 that cannot be allowed to continue to exist as any kind of
 fighting force, that as long as Hamas
 exists as a structure, it will continue planning and using
 creative means to try to figure out how
 to strike at Israel's weaknesses and so that they need to
 destroy Hamas. They can't just treat
 it as something where a couple people committed a crime.
 The thing that was Hamas cannot be allowed
 to exist. How does that fall within the way international
 law understands the kinds of responses
 that are reasonable here? I think the view that the
 absolute destruction and extermination of
 your adversary is the war objective is simply grossly
 disproportionate and impermissible as a
 matter of USAD Bellum, which is to say the law governing
 resort to the use of force.
 Hamas does not represent an existential threat to Israel.
 Israel is saying that our objective in
 this war is to destroy all Hamas military presence, period.
 So then it's basically a
 no holds barred situation because the argument is there are
 tunnels underneath everywhere.
 So the way that Israel is interpreting internationally
 monetary in law here,
 it's deliberate choice to prioritize military necessity
 over the principles of proportionality
 and distinction and also to describe military necessity
 with respect to its overall strategic
 objectives rather than answering the question whether this
 object in this concrete and direct
 way is contributing to a specific military advantage in
 that moment is reinterpreting the rules in a
 way that undermine both the spirit and the law of
 internationally mandatory law because it eviscerates
 the law's ability to protect civilians. What's made much
 more complicated is that Israel is not
 always clear in claiming that it's Hamas as a armed actor
 that must be destroyed.
 Oftentimes it seems as if it's just Hamas as a whole and
 Hamas has many different
 characteristics. It is an armed faction in Gaza, but it is
 also the governing authority that
 represents all of the civil service, all of the bureaucracy
, all of the municipal services,
 everything that enables any territory to run from crossing
 guards to sanitation workers
 to people who are operating the hospital systems. And so
 the idea of destroying the governing
 authority is totally impermissible and would be actually
 targeting of the civilian infrastructure,
 which is indeed something I think we're seeing. And so
 there's a troubling question of what
 does Israel, how does Israel define the object that's
 seeking to eliminate or exterminate.
 And in the context of Gaza, which is a very, very small
 territory with a very dense
 civilian population is going to have the kinds of
 consequences we've seen of just
 grotesque, disproportionate harm to civilians.
 Is this a place where international law and what you might
 call international practice diverge?
 Because it is difficult for me to imagine all that many
 countries suffering the kind of attack
 from a neighboring territory that Israel suffered and not
 believing their objective is to wipe out
 the governing authority that planned, financed and launched
 that attack.
 I mean, the obvious, I think, analogy for Americans is Al-
Qaeda after 9/11 was certainly the way the
 American political establishment initially absorbed this
 moment, right? Joe Biden kind of
 making the point of how many 9/11s this would feel like to
 Israel, even as many of us really
 push the idea that our response to 9/11 was misguided. But
 it wasn't an effort to invoke
 that same sense of how a country might reasonably be
 expected to respond to this kind of security
 risk. So there's a question of international law here, but
 there's also the question of
 what do countries typically do under this kind of pressure.
 And I wonder if those two diverge for you.
 So it's an interesting question to begin with the idea of a
 country facing an armed attack
 from another country. And what does it do is, of course,
 the premise of all of the laws of war.
 And let's think of the context of Ukraine and Russia, for
 example, we don't imagine a scenario
 in which it's permissible for either of those actors to
 have as a war objective the complete
 elimination and extermination of all fighting forces and
 the governing structure of the other.
 We would understand that to be a kind of total war that's
 ruled out. And if either parties seem
 as if it was pursuing that kind of a maximalist goal, that
 would be rejected out of hand. So
 it really depends on where you sit. If you're the United
 States and you choose to see Hamas
 as the equivalent of al-Qaeda on 9/11, you might choose one
 set of repertoires. And as you say,
 international law required constraints that the United
 States did not observe post 9/11
 and came to regret it for the reasons you were suggesting.
 Many of us believe that the U.S.
 response post 9/11 was disastrous, not only for those that
 were the targets of U.S.
 force, but also for the United States itself, which in fact
 suggests that there is a purpose to
 the rules and that enabling their constraining function may
 actually be in the interest of all
 parties. But if you're sitting elsewhere in the world, for
 example, in the global south,
 then you might not think of Hamas as similar to al-Qaeda,
 but rather to the national liberation
 movement that achieved independence in your own country.
 And the rest of the world, the global
 south at least, fought very hard for a law that entrenched
 that right of armed resistance in the
 international legal order through the additional protocols,
 to the Geneva Conventions and through
 a range of subsequent customer international law that has
 grown up around the Geneva Conventions
 and the additional protocols that recognize national
 liberation movements as a very different
 kind of actor, a sort of proto-state military, rather than
 an actor that can be compared to
 al-Qaeda or a terrorist group that isn't connected to a
 claim of national self-determination.
 I want to go back to something you said a minute ago about
 Russian Ukraine,
 because I actually did understand something like the
 governing authority of this country is
 illegitimate and a danger to us and needs to be wiped out
 completely as Russia's at least stated
 objective of what they were trying to do in Ukraine. And I
 think this gets to this question
 somewhat of enforcement where I think Russia's general
 invasion was rejected within international
 law. And yet there is this kind of shimmering, crazy-making
 sense around it, where Russia did
 the thing that is most abhorred under international law,
 just launched an invasion of a neighboring
 country for functionally no reason whatsoever. And yet
 Russia maintains its standing in the
 international system as it has always been. It's sitting
 there on the UN Security Council.
 The fact that its efforts have been rejected has not
 mattered all that much. If we are looking at
 the Russia-Ukraine analogy alongside this, I do think that
 is one where people look at the system
 and they say, "This is no system at all. This is just power
 dressed up as laws. Not laws that
 actually act to constrain power." In Russia and Ukraine, it
's one thing to say that the goals of
 Russia are to defeat the Ukrainian government and to
 perhaps remove the leadership of the Ukrainian
 government. And it's another thing to say that the goal of
 Russia is to wipe them out and exterminate
 them. So I don't think we have any evidence to suggest at
 this point that they have articulated
 an expectation, for example, of taking every person who has
 served in the Ukrainian government
 from trash collectors to sanitation workers, to civilian
 crossing guards, to policemen,
 to K-12 teachers, et cetera, and just kill them all.
 Is that Israel's goal though? Because that's also to mine.
 I have a deep critique of the way
 Israel is conducted this war, but I don't hear them saying
 that every doctor who works for the
 Hamas government should be killed here. I mean, that also
 sounds like beyond what Israel has
 described as their goal. I was just pointing out that the
 goal of wiping out Hamas has the
 potential to be read in three different ways. There's the
 armed actor, there's the governing
 infrastructure, and there's the social movement, and there
's ambiguity in the way that Israel
 describes it. More generally, Israel has targeted, for
 example, the police force, it has targeted
 civilian infrastructure of a variety of kinds. It's hard to
 say exactly what their goals are,
 but I didn't mean to assert that they had the goal of
 killing those people. I'm just saying,
 if that were a goal, it would be impermissible. That kind
 of total war would be impermissible
 under any circumstances in any context, whether between
 states or with respect to a non-state
 actor, et cetera. That was the sense in which I was
 invoking Russia and Ukraine earlier in our
 conversation, that we don't understand that to be the
 Russian war goal. The challenge that we have
 in saying that Israelis have established the complete
 destruction and elimination of Hamas
 as the objective of the war raises troubling implications
 of total war that I think we wouldn't
 permit in any context. Even the suggestion of destroying
 the entire military, I mean,
 for example, the United States clearly had in mind in its
 invasion of Iraq and subsequent
 occupation of Iraq, destroying Saddam Hussein's capacity to
 wield his military. It didn't entail
 destroying every last fighting man or fighting age man in
 Iraq. Indeed, it didn't involve even
 disarming all Iraqis. These are not the kinds of objectives
 that we have. Typically, it's a
 decapitation of the leadership and then a preservation to
 the extent possible of infrastructure that
 will make governing the day after possible. It's not always
 clear in the case of the war against Hamas
 that Israel is making any of these distinctions. What are
 in your view the clearest violations
 of the laws of war that have happened during Israel's
 invasion of Gaza?
 I think the one that is probably the easiest to document
 and substantiate is the blocking of
 access to humanitarian aid and what is now amounting to the
 crime of starvation.
 Because Israel, the officials declared in the immediate
 aftermath of October 7th that they were
 going to cut off all food, all fuel, all water and have
 proceeded to oversee a scheme in which
 they control today all points of entry and egress from Gaza
 and have precluded humanitarian aid
 necessary for subsistence of the Gaza population to enter
 the territory and have also denied
 humanitarian actors the ability to supply that aid. So
 blocking humanitarian assistance,
 including food, medicine, fuel, water treatment, hospitals,
 that I think is the clearest
 and most easily established war crime. I think the
 deliberate targeting in some instances or at
 least indiscriminate bombardment of areas that have dense
 concentrations of civilians is difficult
 in the context of war crimes, as you know, and the
 violations of international humanitarian law
 to establish the requisite intent. But examples of
 indiscriminate killing that are well known
 includes the killing of Israeli hostages when they were had
 escaped and were walking clearly
 unarmed with their hands up carrying white flags and were
 nonetheless executed.
 And then the strike on the world central kitchen for car
 convoy. These are cases where because of
 the identity of those that were struck, Israel has felt the
 need to explain its conduct and others
 have scrutinized the conduct. But I think these are very
 small examples of a much, much wider pattern.
 Unfortunately, the deaths of 34,000 plus Gazans has simply
 not attracted the same level of international
 focus. But there are statements that have been made on the
 record by Israeli military authorities
 and idea of spokespeople together with the empirical record
 of enormous destruction of all civilian
 infrastructure in Gaza that make it relatively more
 straightforward than in other context to
 establish that the war crime of indiscriminate bombardment
 of civilian areas has occurred.
 There are, I think, two major categories here that I want
 to think about not separately,
 but for different reasons. So one is the actions that I
 think it is fair to say are targeted at
 civilians, or at least indiscriminately, truly indiscrim
inately targeted at civilians like the
 siege. And I mean, that has always seemed to me to be a war
 crime. And the sort of American
 defense of it has, I think, been disappointing. The other
 piece of it, which you brought up around
 these tunnels, what Israel says is that Hamas is using
 international law against it. That Hamas
 uses civilian shields. And I cannot judge whether this is
 true, but take it as plausible for the
 moment that Hamas works out of schools and hospitals. And
 the Israelis have said, well,
 because of that, it means that, unfortunately, we have had
 to destroy. I mean, there's just a
 time's report on the huge proportion of Gaza schools that
 have just been wrecked.
 And so Israel's argument is that this is not Israel's fault
. It is Hamas's fault that it is
 Hamas that is decided to hide among civilians and to use
 both civilians and civilian infrastructure
 as shields, as disguises, as operating bases. And so the
 consequence of this falls on them.
 How does international law treat a question like that? When
 you do have a force that at least to
 some degree is using civilians and civilian infrastructure
 as kind of shields collateral damage and operating
 bases? Obviously in places and in territories where you
 have a dense civilian population,
 there is infrastructure that is helping adversaries armed
 forces sustain itself on which the civilian
 population is also deeply dependent. Targeting that on the
 grounds that it's dual use is not only in
 violation of the spirit of international humanitarian law
 and the goal of protecting civilians and
 minimizing harm to civilians in conflict. But in many cases
, it's also a violation of the rules,
 which brings us to human shields and that argument. So the
 definition of using human shields for a
 matter of international law is the deliberate placement of
 civilians and proximity to military
 objectives during a conflict. It's not the presence of
 civilians in densely populated areas from
 which armed groups also operate. Gaza is a tiny territory
 and inevitably on a territory that small
 that has 2.3 million people residing, you're going to have
 civilians close to places where Hamas
 operates no matter what. Under those circumstances, the
 rules require that Israel take precautions
 that are available to take. So let's take an example of the
 hospitals. Let's say Arguendo
 that Hamas was using a hospital or was present underneath a
 hospital, then what would be the
 measures that Israel is permitted to take in order to
 address the tactical military advantage of
 an actual Hamas presence, an armed presence in that moment
 near or under that hospital.
 First of all, Israel would have to evacuate the civilians
 or create an opportunity for the
 civilians that are in the hospital to be evacuated. It
 would have to facilitate access to medical
 supplies and necessary humanitarian assistance for patients
 to be transferred for patients in
 need of care. It would also have to ascertain where it
 believes Hamas is present and narrowly
 target whatever strike or attack to that particular
 location. And it's not simply that you warn a
 population of an attack. It's that you provide them a
 meaningful opportunity to be evacuated
 from an area. You will offer them safe passage and you
 enable them to travel to somewhere where
 they will be safe. Instead, we've seen warnings without
 opportunities to evacuate or where evacuation
 passageways have themselves been the subject of targeting
 for attack and where people have
 been directed to places that themselves have continued to
 be bombarded. Let's just look at
 the laws of war for a moment and see what they're designed
 to do. They're not designed primarily
 for ex post accountability and, you know, to be used in an
 international criminal setting.
 They're designed for ex ante incorporation in the military
 manuals and books and rules that
 govern armed forces, how they're trained and what they're
 told they can or can't do. Now,
 I think there's good reason to think that there has been a
 dramatic shift in Israel in the internal
 rules of engagement. We're probably not going to be able to
 establish whether that's true or not
 in the immediate period because Israel will remain the most
 powerful actor on the ground and will
 not subject itself to that kind of third party inquiry, but
 the rules are failing to constrain
 Israel first and foremost because Israel has ceased to
 internalize those rules. The use of such
 heavy weaponry as 2,000 pound bombs or the shelling with
 very heavy artillery of civilian areas where
 civilian populations remain present is quite distinctive in
 this context because it's happened
 so frequently and with such a high level of ordinance that
 sets it apart from essentially any other
 conflict to date, at least that the United States has been
 involved with or implicated in.
 One thing that has been interesting to me as the Biden
 administration has been shifting its
 position somewhat over the past, you know, I'll call it two
 or three months is that as much as
 international law has not been able to constrain Israel on
 its own, it is the tool the Biden
 administration increases seems to be using as it looks for
 a way to reconcile its own positions.
 It wasn't there when they didn't want it to be there, but
 when they don't seem to want their
 position to simply be, Joe Biden has had enough. He thinks
 they've gone too far. It does sort of
 operate as this other language, this sort of agreed upon
 language. I'm curious how you think about
 that sort of role of this, even where international law
 cannot work as an in-the-moment enforcement
 mechanism. It is something that can be used at times to
 create sort of mounting moral pressure or
 justified decisions that would not otherwise work
 politically.
 Yeah, I mean, I think that's clear. And again, I just want
 to go back to where we started at the
 very beginning of our conversation in thinking about how
 does law work as a general matter.
 We don't say in a domestic system that has periodic surges
 in murder rates that the law of homicide
 doesn't exist or doesn't work or is unenforceable. Even if
 it's the case that there are people that
 escape the capacity of the law to actually hold them
 individually accountable for one reason or
 another, the fact that people break the law and sometimes
 get away with it doesn't mean the law
 doesn't exist and doesn't have force. The Biden
 administration came into office in part
 signaling at home and abroad that it was breaking from the
 Trump administration, breaking from a
 period of what it viewed as lawless rule and returning to a
 rule-based order rehabilitating
 the US reputation. What we have now entered into is a
 period of a return of serious
 multipolarity. That is to say, the United States faces a
 range of actors, some larger, some smaller,
 that for a variety of reasons, either in their particular
 spheres of influence or globally,
 have emerged as either adversaries or challengers. In this
 context, of course, each of them is able
 to make recourse to the precedent set by the United States
 of failing to constrain when they
 want to act. They'll point to Kosovo, they'll point to Iraq
, they'll point to Libya, and we're
 seeing the consequences of those precedents now when they
're wielded to legitimate uses of force
 we disagree with. There is that phenomenon for starters,
 and that indicates a universe in which
 all actors, not just the United States, have to either be
 far more careful about the ways in which
 they continue to erode the existing international legal
 infrastructure or in which we are moving
 in the direction of regional fragmented interpretations of
 what the international rules are,
 powerful actors commanding authority within their own era
 abroad, becoming stronger and over time,
 the production of precisely the kinds of dynamics that
 resulted in the world wars of the 20th century.
 So for much of the war, the US has used its veto at the
 Security Council to stop any
 resolutions calling for a ceasefire. Then in March, when
 another one came along, this one
 written somewhat differently, the US abstained and allowed
 it to pass. The Israelis ignored it,
 and then the US called it non-binding. And there was a
 State Department briefing where a reporter
 asked about this. So you don't believe anything is going to
 happen as a result of the passage of
 this resolution. So I think that separate and apart from
 this resolution, we have active ongoing
 negotiations to try to achieve what this resolution calls
 for, which is the an immediate ceasefire and
 the release of hostages. I don't know, I can't say that
 this impact this resolution is going to
 have any impact on those negotiations. So I don't expect
 you to answer this now, but to me you just
 stick this in your pocket. If that's the case, what the
 hell is the point of the UN or the UN Security
 Council? That was really a moment, I think, that made the
 contradictions in our relationship
 to international law pretty stark. There's actually a
 precedent for the United States
 treating a UN Security Council resolution and turning
 around and presenting it as non-binding.
 And strikingly, it was in the South African context. You
 had a very similar situation
 during apartheid that we find ourselves in now, in which
 the UN General Assembly, the overwhelming
 majority of states in the international system, passed
 resolution after resolution after resolution
 with enormous majorities in support of denunciations of the
 South African regime of apartheid, calls for
 sanctions, arms and bar goes, all kinds of things. In the
 General Assembly, while it doesn't have the
 power to issue resolutions that have binding law, that are
 at the force of binding law, it has
 enormous power to shape agendas. And it did do that, even
 as the US and the UK, and to some
 extent France, continued to use their role in the Security
 Council to shield the South African
 government. The General Assembly ended up setting the
 global agenda for how one should understand
 South Africa. And over time, the Security Council had no
 choice under enormous pressure to finally
 agree to some very, very mild measures against South Africa
. But the very first such resolution
 passed by the Security Council involved exactly the same
 pattern. And then the US delegate turning
 around and saying, well, this is non-binding and having an
 enormous debate about how to interpret
 Security Council resolutions, et cetera. In the end, in the
 grand scheme of things, it just didn't
 matter because the overall momentum in the system was
 against the South African government. And in
 the coming years after that, South Africa had come to
 become such an illegitimate actor globally
 that the Security Council finally did pass binding
 resolutions involving arms and margos. And as we
 know, there was an eventual transition in South Africa to a
 post-apartheid system. So this non-binding
 resolution around the ceasefire could also be seen as the
 first in a series of steps that might
 occur in this relationship between international public
 opinion, international law, the General
 Assembly, international courts, the UN Security Council,
 that shift our attention away from the
 longstanding international humanitarian law framework that
 has dominated and that has forced us to look
 specifically at the rules for belligerent occupation and
 the rules of the conduct of hostilities when
 Israel engages in a variety of kinds of operations against
 Gaza or against the West Bank to shift
 our gaze from all of that and instead return our attention
 to the question of the entirety of the
 mandate and ask a question about what the future would look
 like politically and legally under
 international law for an authority that governs 14 million
 people where 7 million people, Jewish
 citizens are fully enfranchised citizens of a democracy and
 the other population of the territory,
 the other 7 million people still have unresolved rights and
 they're still sitting on the territory
 as well. And then all is our final question. What are three
 books you'd recommend to the audience?
 Yeah, thank you so much for giving me a chance to recommend
 some great books. The first,
 I would recommend is Antony Angie's Imperialism, Sovere
ignty, and the Making of International Law,
 which retails the history of international law as well as
 the intellectual history of canonical
 European jurists by centering the colonial encounter as the
 structuring event that triggered the
 emergence of international laws. We know it. I would also
 recommend Nuda Erikaats, Justice for Some,
 Law and the Question of Palestine, which provides a
 detailed and highly readable account of how
 international law first facilitated British colonial rule
 and then how it's been used by
 Israelis and Palestinians to organize on the one hand and
 resist on the other. I would also
 recommend Adam get to choose world-making after empire, the
 rise and fall of self-determination,
 which returns to the era of decolonization to offer an
 account of how the principle of
 self-determination was differently understood by anti-
colonial leaders and how that understanding
 how it prevailed might have yielded alternatives to logics
 of partition, logics like the logic that
 underlies the UN's involvement in Israel-Palestine and
 ideas of the two-state solution.
 And then with your indulgence, I'm going to recommend a
 fourth book, Aziz Rana is the
 constitutional bind, how Americans came to idolize a
 document that bails them, which is a wonderful
 book just published that provides an eye-opening and
 beautifully rendered account
 of how we as Americans came to be bound to a constitution
 that makes it so difficult to hold
 our own government accountable or to translate public
 preferences into changes in our policies,
 a question that I believe has renewed urgency at a time
 when polls show that consistent
 majorities in the United States support a permanent
 ceasefire in Gaza.
