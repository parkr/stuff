        Weeks of wet weather preceding Lincolnʼs second inauguration had caused Pennsylvania Avenue to become a sea of mud and standing water. Thousands of
      spectators stood in thick mud at the Capitol grounds to hear the President. As he stood on the East Portico to take the executive oath, the completed
   Capitol dome over the Presidentʼs head was a physical reminder of the resolve of his Administration throughout the years of civil war. Chief Justice Salmon
                            Chase administered the oath of office. In little more than a month, the President would be assassinated.

                                                                       Fellow-Countrymen:
      AT this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. Then a
    statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations
   have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation,
    little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it
           is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.    1
     On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert
   it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city
   seeking to destroy it without war--seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make
                      war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came. 2
     One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves
     constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this
    interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the
   territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the
    cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental
   and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare
     to ask a just Godʼs assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other menʼs faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of
     both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. "Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it
      must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh." If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses
   which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both
     North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes
   which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.
     Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsmanʼs two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until
   every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said "the
                                                   judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether." 3
      With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are
      in, to bind up the nationʼs wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and
                                            cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations. 4
