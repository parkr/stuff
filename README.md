A collection of cool stuff accumulated over the years

## Testing

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/parkr/stuff.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/parkr/stuff)

## Credit

I mean it's just a collection of stuff [Parker Moore](https://parkermoore.de)
compiled. The actual stuff will have links to the source website - that should
provide some info on who is actually to blame for such awesomeness.
