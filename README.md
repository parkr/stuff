stuff
=====

A collection of cool stuff accumulated over the years

## Credit

I mean it's just a collection of stuff [Parker Moore](http://parkermoore.de)
compiled. The actual stuff will have links to the source website - that should
provide some info on who is actually to blame for such awesomeness.
